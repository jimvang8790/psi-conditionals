# JavaScript Review

## Topics

```
- variables
- data types
- conditionals
- loops
- arrays
- objects
- builtins
- functions/methods
- switches
- prototypes
```

You and your partner will get two topics from the list above. It is your job to lead the class in a refresher on the topics assigned to you.

## Steps:

1. Write an example using JavaScript to demonstrate this topic.
2. If applicable, write or find an example or examples of this topic mixed in with some of the other technologies that we with the full stack.
3. Explain When do you use it? and Why do you use it?
4. Sign up for [https://edabit.com/](https://edabit.com/). Find one or more problems that uses the topic. Solve this problem and review other solutions on the site.
5. Commit all these descriptions to a README.md file in a github repo.
6. Present to class and share the notes you created in step five.


## Topic: Switches

2. Link to question: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34131341/how-to-write-switch-statement-in-angularjs-controller

3. A statement that is more convenient to use when you have code that needs to choose a path from many to follow. A switch statement is essentially the same as a series of "if" and "else-if" statements. "So, what's the point of even having a switch statement", you may ask. Well, it's simple to use, logical in syntax, and most importantly, many programmers swear by it. You don't have to adopt it when writing conditional statements; in fact, you won't even notice a difference. But as my old science teacher used to say "Try it, you'll like it!"


## Topic: Conditionals

2. Link to edabit question: https://edabit.com/challenge/nQtiQCoqM6rxWpZmC

3. Conditional statements are used to perform different actions based on different conditions.
  In JavaScript we have the following conditional statements:

      - Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
      - Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
      - Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
      - Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed
